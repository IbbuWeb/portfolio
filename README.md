## ✨ Portfolio Design Concept

### Fixed Animated Background + Windowed Content

- The background contains a **subtle animated particle/noise effect**
- The animation is **fixed** and does not scroll
- Content appears inside **solid / semi-transparent window-like sections**
- These sections **mask the animation behind them**
- Only the content windows scroll, creating a clean and premium visual effect

This design keeps the focus on readability while adding a modern, technical atmosphere.
